TouchDesigner-ISF-parser
========================

This Touch project parses ISF files converts them to touchdesigner GLSL shaders as well as 
]creating/connecting any necessary operators and declaring uniform variables.

Yet to be implemented are multiple passes and image loading.
Some shaders require some manual tweaks to make the touch/compatible.

This is very much incomplete but might be a good jumping off point 
for anyone wanting to accomplish a similar thing.
