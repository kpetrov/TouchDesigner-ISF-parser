TouchDesigner-ISF-parser
========================

This TouchDesigner project parses ISF files converts them to touchdesigner GLSL shaders as well as creating/connecting any necessary operators and declaring uniform variables.

Some shaders require various amounts of manual tweaking to make touch-compatible.

Details on the ISF format here: http://vdmx.vidvox.net/blog/isf
Yet to be implemented are multiple passes and image loading.
